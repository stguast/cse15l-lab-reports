# week 7 lab report
**PART ONE**<br>
`/File[]<Enter>I<Enter><Esc>kISystem.out.println(f.toString() + "is a directory");<Esc>:wq<Enter>`

![lab 7 screenshot 1](lab7-screenshot1.png)<br>
Here I type `/File[]<Enter>` and the cursor jumps to the start of `/File[]`.<br>

![lab 7 screenshot 2](lab7-screenshot2.png)<br>Here I type `I` to go into Insert Mode and press `<Enter>` to create a space for my line.<br>

![lab 7 screenshot 3](lab7-screenshot3.png)<br>Here I type `<Esc>` to exit Insert Mode, going into Normal Mode. Then I press `k` to move up a line, and `I` to go back into Insert Mode. <br>

![lab 7 screenshot 4](lab7-screenshot4.png)<br>Here I type the command we were told to insert: `System.out.println(f.toString() + "is a directory");`<br>

![lab 7 screenshot 5](lab7-screenshot5.png)<br>I press `I` to exit Insert Mode.<br>

![lab 7 screenshot 6](lab7-screenshot6.png)<br>Then I press `:wq<Enter>` to write and quit; as you can see from the screenshot, the command has been added to my file. <br><br>

**PART TWO**<br>
First style: 147 seconds<br>
Second style: 62 seconds<br>
I forgot to copy paste the appropriate scp command so the first style took me a little longer!<br><br>
I prefer being already logged into an ssh session (second style) and making the edit in Vim; I think it's a lot more time efficient than copying the file over, logging in, and running it. <br><br>
If the project requires several lengthy edits, I might choose the first style since I'm not too used to vim yet and writing the edits directly into the file would be quicker for me for now.
